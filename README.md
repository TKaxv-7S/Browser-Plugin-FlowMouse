## 💡 Origin

For many years, I was a loyal user of CrxMouse, and it truly improved my operational efficiency. However, long-term use came with a persistent annoyance: it frequently requested "advanced feature" permissions—essentially attempting to access my browsing history. Valuing my privacy, I never consented.

A few months ago, a CrxMouse update caused anomalies when I visited the 52pojie forum: users could not log in, could not rate posts, and pages would not automatically redirect after replying. After troubleshooting, I quickly confirmed the root cause was a JavaScript script injected by the extension. Many users on the forum reported the same trouble, initially suspecting a website issue, but it was actually a plugin compatibility problem affecting all Discuz! forums.

I hoped the plugin author would fix it quickly. Unfortunately, despite two consecutive updates, the problem persisted. After waiting over a month with no progress, I realized I might need to look for an alternative. However, there were very few similar extensions on the market, and none fully met my needs.

So, I decided to build it myself. Thus, FlowMouse was born.

I still want to acknowledge CrxMouse. It not only boosted my efficiency for years, but the issues it exposed were the direct catalyst for this new extension. I also want to thank the Edge browser. Aside from the core gestures I use frequently, the remaining gestures in FlowMouse were implemented based on Edge's standard gestures. I have always envied the smoothness and compatibility of Edge's native gestures—compared to drawing trails via JavaScript, native support feels significantly better.

FlowMouse aims to continue the convenience of gesture operations while prioritizing privacy protection and stable compatibility. This is a small project born from actual needs and a return to user experience. If you have encountered similar troubles, perhaps this offers you a new choice.
