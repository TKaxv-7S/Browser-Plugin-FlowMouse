## Privacy

FlowMouse is an open source extension. The code is hosted on GitHub and open to review and contribution.

- FlowMouse **does not collect** any browsing history, bookmarks, or usage habits.
- FlowMouse **does not contain** any analytics or advertising code.
- FlowMouse **does not upload** any local data to third-party servers.

FlowMouse settings are stored locally via the browser's storage API. If browser sync is enabled (e.g., Chrome Sync, Firefox Sync), settings are encrypted and synced across your signed-in devices by the browser. This process is entirely controlled by your browser and follows your browser's privacy and sync settings.

## The story behind FlowMouse

For years, I was a loyal CrxMouse user. It genuinely improved my productivity. But one thing always bugged me: it kept requesting "advanced feature" permissions, which really meant access to my browsing history. I never agreed.

Then one day, a CrxMouse update broke things on the 52pojie forum: users couldn't log in, couldn't rate posts, and pages stopped redirecting after replying. I traced the issue to a JavaScript snippet injected by the extension. Other users reported the same problems, thinking the site itself was broken, but it was actually caused by the extension and affected all Discuz!-based forums.

I expected the author to fix it quickly. Two updates came and went, but the bug remained. After waiting over a month with no progress, I started looking for alternatives. There were very few similar extensions on the market, and none of them fully met my needs.

So I decided to build my own. That's how FlowMouse was born.

I still want to give credit to CrxMouse. It boosted my efficiency for years, and the problems it caused were the direct reason this project exists. I also want to thank Edge browser. Beyond the core gestures I use daily, FlowMouse's remaining gestures were modeled after Edge's built-in gesture set. I've always admired the smoothness and compatibility of Edge's native gestures; compared to drawing trails via JavaScript, native support is in a different league.

FlowMouse aims to carry on the convenience of gesture navigation while putting privacy and compatibility first. It's a small project born from a real need. If you've run into similar frustrations, maybe it can be a good alternative for you.
