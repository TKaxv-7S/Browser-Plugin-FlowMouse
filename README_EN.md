## 💡 Origin Story

For many years, I have been a loyal user of CrxMouse; it truly greatly improved my operational efficiency. However, a persistent annoyance accompanied my long-term usage: it frequently prompted requests for "advanced feature" permissions—essentially seeking access to my visited URL history. Out of a commitment to privacy, I never consented.

Until a few months ago, a version update of CrxMouse led to anomalies when I visited the 52PoJie forum: users couldn't log in, couldn't rate posts, and pages wouldn't even auto-redirect after replying. Through troubleshooting, I quickly confirmed the root cause was the JavaScript injected by the plugin. Many other users in the forum reported similar issues, assuming it was a website problem, when in fact it was a plugin compatibility issue.

I hoped the plugin author would fix it quickly. Unfortunately, despite two subsequent updates, the issue persisted. After waiting for over a month with no progress, I realized I might need to find an alternative. However, there were few similar plugins on the market, and their functions hardly met my needs.

So, I decided to do it myself. And thus, FlowMouse was born.

Here, I still want to thank CrxMouse. Not only did it bring me efficiency improvements for many years, but the problems it exposed directly catalyzed the development of this new plugin. I also want to thank the Edge browser. Aside from the few core gestures I use frequently, the remaining gestures in FlowMouse were complemented by referencing Edge's common gestures. I've always envied the smooth performance and excellent compatibility of Edge's native gestures—after all, native support is indeed much better than drawing trails via JavaScript.

FlowMouse hopes to continue the convenience of gesture operations while placing greater emphasis on privacy protection and stable compatibility. This is a small project born from actual needs and returning to user experience. If you have encountered similar troubles, perhaps this can offer you a new choice.
